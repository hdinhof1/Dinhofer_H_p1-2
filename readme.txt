C++
g++ compiler uses make 
	run using ./program1 -m <market-price-file> -p <price-list-file> 
	i.e. ./program1 -m market-price-file.txt -p price-list-file.txt



Errors:
	With mutliple sets it won't run. Will segfault. Comment out next_permutation, Driver.cpp line 166. Should've done two for loops. Runs market-price-file.txt successfully. See Dinhofer_H_output.txt for correct output.

“I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I will receive a grade of “F” for the course for any additional offense.”
